    <p> Below is a list of all my work experience related to computer science, as well as a little bit about each one. </p>
    <h3> Undergraduate Research Assistant </h3>
	<p><i> University of Guelph, May 2023 - Aug 2023 </i><br><br>
	During this time I worked under Dr. Cortland Griswold helping him with his research.<br>
	Through my experiences working for Dr. Griswold, I was able to improve my C++ skills, learn a lot about parallel programming, and also improve my Python skills quite a bit. <br>
	
	Here are some of the notable things I did during my time at this job:<br>
	<ul>
		<li>Refactored an OpenCL (C++) project that uses a stochastic model to simulate processes in population
genetics and molecular evolution over millions of generations</li>
		<li>Ported the refactored project to other GPU computing platforms such as CUDA (C++) and Metal
(Objective-C++)</li>
		<li>Created 7 Python scripts to verify simulation results, such as validating the distribution of sites within a
genome affected by mutation</li>
		<li>Created 3 Python scripts to automate part of the testing process, allowing for 37 different datasets to be
run with with one command, rather than one at a time</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	
	<h3> Teaching Assistant - CIS 2500 (Intermediate Programming) </h3>
	<p><i> University of Guelph, January 2023 - April 2023 </i><br> <br>
	During this time I was a teaching assistant for the University of Guelph's Winter 2023 CIS 2500 (Intermediate Programming) offering. <br>
	At this position I was able to increase my skills with the C programming language, public speaking, and software development as a whole. <br>
	
	Here are some of the notable things I did during my time at this job:<br>
	<ul>
		<li>Developed autograders for assignments in Python and C alongside another TA</li>
		<li>Presented a lecture to students about how to use Git and GNU Make alongside another TA</li>
		<li>Taught intermediate programming concepts (dynamic memory management, pointers, data structures,
sorting algorithms) to students in C</li>
		<li>Led 3 lab sections containing approximately 35 students each alongside another TA</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	
	<h3> Teaching Assistant - CIS 1300 (Programming) </h3>
	<p><i> University of Guelph, September 2022 - December 2022</i><br><br>
	During this time I was a teaching assistant for the University of Guelph's Fall 2022 CIS 1300 (Programming) offering. <br>
	I was able to refresh my knowledge of the C programming language, and also tried (and succeeded in) writing Bash scripts for the first time.<br>
	
	Here are some of the notable things I did during my time at this job:<br>
	<ul>
		<li>Created Bash scripts to automate user input when grading assignments, leading to a significant
increase in marking speed among all TAs</li>
		<li>Taught beginner programming concepts (arrays, loops, functions, files, pointers) to students in C</li>
		<li>Taught students how to use the Linux command line for software development and file management</li>
		<li>Led 3 lab sections containing approximately 40 students each alongside another TA</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	
	<h3> Teaching Assistant - CIS 1050 (Web Design and Development) </h3>
	<p><i> University of Guelph, May 2022 - August 2022</i><br><br>
	This position was my first computer science related position ever. I was a teaching assistant for the University of Guelph's Summer 2022 CIS 1050 (Web Design and Development) offering.<br>
	Through this job, I was able to become more knowledgeable about good web design practices, as well as become more comfortable with HTML & CSS.<br>
	
	Here are some of the notable things I did during my time at this job: <br>
	<ul>
		<li>Graded and provided feedback for assignments written in HTML and CSS</li>
		<li>Answered questions about class material and assignments on the class forums</li>
		<li>Encouraged by the professor to TA the class again in the future</li>
	</ul>
