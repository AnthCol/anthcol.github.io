	<h3> SDF-Molecule-Viewer </h3>
	<p>
	<a href="https://github.com/AnthCol/SDF-Molecule-Viewer">Project Link</a><br><br>
	<i>Languages:</i> Python, C, JavaScript, SQL, HTML, CSS<br>
	<i>Technologies/Libraries:</i> jQuery, SWIG, SQLite, GNU Make, Regex<br><br>
	This project is full-stack web application created as part of the "Software Systems Development and Integration" (CIS 2750) course at the University of Guelph. <br>
	The version of the project here is an upgraded version of the one I submitted for the course. <br>
	
	Here is what the project can do:<br>
	<ul>
		<li>Allows the user to upload a .sdf file which will be parsed using Regex expressions</li>
		<li>The parsed data will be added to an SQLite database, where it can be later used to generate an SVG display of a molecule at the users request</li>
		<li>The user is able to customize the SVG by inputting information about the types of atoms in the molecule through an HTML form</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	
	<h3> MIX-Interpreter </h3>
	<p>
	<a href="https://github.com/AnthCol/MIX-Interpreter">Project Link</a><br><br>
	<i>Languages:</i> Go <br>
	<i>Technologies/Libraries:</i> GNU Make<br><br>
	This project is currently in-progress. It is an interpreter for the MIX assembly language described in Dr. Donald Knuth's "The Art of Computer Programming" Volume 1.<br>
	This work is also my first experience with the Go programming language. <br>
	
	It is not currently functional, but eventually I intend for it to be able to do the following things:<br>
	<ul>
		<li>Perform syntax checking for all MIX instructions</li>
		<li>Additional commands to the language will be added for debugging purposes, so that the user can see crucial information about the program during runtime</li>
		<li>When the interpreter is run, there will be flag options such as allowing the user to skip syntax checking, as well as having the program print out the state of the RAM after it has executed </li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	
	<h3> SSBM-Comparator </h3>
	<p>
	<a href="https://github.com/AnthCol/SSBM-Comparator">Project Link</a><br><br>
	<i>Languages:</i> Java <br>
	<i>Technologies/Libraries:</i> Gradle, Java Swing<br><br>
	
	This project was my first ever attempt at writing software outside of school (I started it shortly after finishing my first two semesters of computer science). <br>
	It was also my first attempt at learning a programming language by myself (Java).<br>
	While this project is not a good reflection of my current skillset, I do think it is worth putting on this website to show how much I have improved since. <br>
	
	Here is what the project is able to do:<br>
	<ul>
		<li>Compare data of up to four Super Smash Bros. Melee characters at once</li>
		<li>Compare the data of a character to the average of all characters</li>
		<li>Rank (sort) all of the damaging moves in the game by their: -> Damage -> Startup Frames -> Active Frames -> Ending Frames</li>
		<li>Rank (sort) character attributes (such as fast falling speed), as well as data about non-damaging moves (such as spot dodge)</li>
	</ul>
